### 🧠 SDG 11: Pollution Clustering (Machine Learning Project)

#### 📌 Project Overview

This project applies **K-Means Clustering** to analyze **air quality data** as part of **Sustainable Development Goal 11 — Sustainable Cities and Communities**. The goal is to group cities based on pollution levels to better understand environmental trends and promote sustainable urban development.

#### 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is **`air_quality.csv`**, which includes information such as:

* PM2.5 concentration
* PM10 concentration
* CO, NO₂, and SO₂ levels
* City names and other attributes

#### ⚙️ Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing (cleaning and normalization)
2. K-Means Clustering using Scikit-Learn
3. Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
4. Interpretation of cluster results

#### 🧾 Results & Analysis

Screenshots of the outputs, including visualizations and clustering results, are stored in the Google Drive link below:
